MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:

OVERVIEW:

The Movie Recommendation System is a content-based recommendation engine that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to suggest movies similar to a user-provided title. By analyzing movie metadata, the system calculates feature vectors and identifies titles with high similarity scores, providing personalized recommendations.

FEATURES:

-> Content-Based Recommendations: Suggests movies based on metadata like genres, cast, and keywords.

-> NLP Techniques: Uses CountVectorizer to process text data and generate feature vectors.

-> Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity between movies to find the best matches.

-> Persistence: Utilizes Pickle for model persistence, enabling efficient reuse of trained models.
-> User-Friendly Interface: Accepts a movie title as input and returns similar movie suggestions.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

-> Programming Language: Python

-> Libraries:
Pandas,
NumPy,
Scikit-learn,
Pickle

-> NLP Technique: CountVectorizer

-> Algorithm: Cosine Similarity
